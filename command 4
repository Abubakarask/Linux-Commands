4. mkdir & rmdir â€” Use the mkdir command when you need to create a folder or a directory. For example, if you want to make a directory called â€œDIYâ€, then you can type â€œmkdir DIYâ€. Remember, as told before, if you want to create a directory named â€œDIY Hackingâ€, then you can type â€œmkdir DIY\ Hackingâ€. Use rmdir to delete a directory. But rmdir can only be used to delete an empty directory. To delete a directory containing files, use rm.
